### What is *lisa*?
*lisa* is an experimental programming language and compiler architecture designed for the simplest and easiest implementation of high performance AI/ML systems.

### The Compiler
The *lisa* compiler is only a frontend for the LLVM compiler infrastructure. It is used to generate LLVM IR code from the `.lisa` source files. The compiler is written in C++ and uses the LLVM C++ API. Future versions of the compiler will be fully self-implemented.

### The Language
The *lisa* programming language is a simple and easy-to-use language designed for the development of machine learning software. It integrates commonly used tools and libraries in AI/ML systems development into its standard library, which will make it fast and easy to implement an intelligent system for research and production alike.
